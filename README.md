* The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark (5 points)
* The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. (5
points)
### Data Model Optimization (25 points)
* The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting
* changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself (15 points)

## Project Concept

## Data Selection and Preprocessing
* Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies?select=titles.csv
* Using Jupyter notebook
* Pandas - drop columns related to TV Shows (seasons, tmbd_popularity, & tmbd_score)
* Spark/SparkSQL - remove TV Shows
* Pandas - 
* remove rows where IMDB_score is null  
* remove [], â€˜, & extra blanks from fields
* Split genres field into separate fields for each genre

## Data Model useage and optimization
* Keras Model was used against 3 genres keras Tuner was used to optimize the models getting 2 of them above the 75% accuracy
* 

## Visualizations using Matplot 
* Plot of genres and the number of people who rated them showed Drama had the most votes
* Plot of min and Max IMDB scores for each Genre shows there was more vartriation in some Genre than others
